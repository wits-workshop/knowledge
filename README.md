# Knowledge on the implementation of type systems

This repository is intended to accumulate our collective knowledge about best practices and other ideas around designing and implementing languages with fancy type systems.

This grew out of WITS (Workshop on the Implementation of Type Systems), first held co-located with POPL 2022.
